# pandas-emetrics
`pandas-emetrics` is an in-progress python package built on top of [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/). My goal with this project is to make ethical considerations in relation to data, such as [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity) and [l-diversity](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~muratk/courses/privacy08f_files/ldiversity.pdf), easily accessable to data scientists, analysts, researchersâ€”basically anyone working with data.


### To-Do
- [ ] implement k_anonymize()
- [ ] further research into possible implementations of [t closeness](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ninghui/papers/t_closeness_icde07.pdf)
- [ ] further research into other ethical considerations that could be useful
- [ ] encrypt() function
- [ ] add unit tests for all functions
- [ ] add_noise() function
